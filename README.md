Backend Repository - https://github.com/Thisal0714/Coding-Assessment/

Two different repositories containing the frontend and the backend. To run the application clone those seperately and run them. For the frontend you will need "npm install axios".

Access the app:
Frontend will be available at: http://localhost:5173
Backend will be available at: http://localhost:8080 

Notes:
Ensure that the backend is running before starting the frontend.
The frontend will interact with the backend API, so make sure to configure the API URL properly in the frontend code if necessary.
